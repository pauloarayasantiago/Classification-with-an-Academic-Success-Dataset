# Student Academic Risk Prediction

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict academic outcomes (Graduate, Dropout, or Enrolled) for higher education students using data available at the time of enrollment. The primary objective is to enable early identification of at-risk students, allowing for timely intervention strategies to improve student retention and success rates.

## Project Overview

The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing student information across multiple dimensions, with 36 distinct features covering academic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. The dataset comprises approximately 4,000 student records with complete information across all measured variables.

The target variable distribution showed an imbalance in the original dataset:
- Graduates: 48.2% of students
- Dropouts: 38.8% of students
- Currently Enrolled: 13.0% of students

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Age Grouping: Created six distinct age bands (15-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-50)
     - Largest group: 15-20 years (42.3% of students)
     - Second largest: 21-25 years (31.7% of students)
     - Remaining groups collectively represent 26% of the population
   
   - Admission Grade Analysis:
     - Mean admission grade: 126.34 (out of 200)
     - Standard deviation: 22.15
     - Quartile ranges:
       - Q1 (0-25%): Below 111.23
       - Q2 (25-50%): 111.23-126.34
       - Q3 (50-75%): 126.34-141.45
       - Q4 (75-100%): Above 141.45

   - Polynomial Feature Generation:
     - Generated 370 interaction features from 18 numerical variables
     - Focused on degree-2 polynomials after testing showed no significant improvement with higher degrees
     - Interaction terms captured relationships between key variables such as:
       - Admission grade × First semester performance
       - Age × Academic performance
       - Economic indicators interactions

2. **Data Balancing Implementation**
   - Applied SMOTE with following parameters:
     - sampling_strategy: 'auto'
     - k_neighbors: 5
     - random_state: 42
   - Results after balancing:
     - Each class represented equally (33.33% each)
     - Total synthetic samples generated: approximately 2,000
     - Validation confirmed no information leakage during synthesis

3. **Model Architecture Details**

The LightGBM classifier was implemented with carefully tuned hyperparameters:

```python
lgb_params = {
    'colsample_bytree': 0.746,  # Prevents overfitting by using 74.6% of features per tree
    'learning_rate': 0.124,     # Balanced learning speed and accuracy
    'max_bin': 251,             # Optimal binning for feature discretization
    'min_child_samples': 7,     # Minimum samples required in leaf node
    'n_estimators': 199,        # Number of boosting rounds
    'num_leaves': 750,          # Maximum number of leaves in each tree
    'reg_alpha': 0.001,         # L1 regularization term
    'reg_lambda': 0.003,        # L2 regularization term
    'force_col_wise': True      # Ensures consistent feature handling
}
```
